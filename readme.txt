after removing the admin tool bar this plugin restores a 3.2-like header with a single one click logout barless simplifies logging out of wp dashboard

**This plugin was approved on this repository online since 2011-11-23**

If you remove the gray admin bar using the [Admin Bar Removal](//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-bar-removal/) plugin by sLa --- a new header and logout link is created by that plugin. One Click Logout Barless works in conjunction with it, most specifically to restore a WP 3.2-like Dashboard header with one-click logout.

Originally, this plugin was a patch for the initial versions of the [Admin Bar Removal](//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-bar-removal/) plugin, and provided logout capabilities lost when the gray admin bar was removed, specifically it restored a WP 3.2-like header and a one-click logout. The latest version of the plugin here, restore the 3.2-like header and logout -- for a prettier barless Dashboard!

Includes multisite support. If you have multisite installed, in the center between the Howdy greeting and the logout link, a "Network Admin" or "Site Admin" link will also appear, depending on whether you're in the Network Dashboard or one of the site Dashboards. It behaves in a similar manner to the 3.1 Dashboard in this regard.

Also, check out my other plugin, [One Click Logout](//wordpress.org/plugins/one-click-logout/) from which this was forked.

Generally:

Replaces the Admin Bar Removal plugin header with a stylistically 3.2-like Dashboard header.

No more admin bar to clutter your dashboard.

No more maneuvering through annoying dropdown menus.

One click and you're out!

Features:

* Adds a 3.2-like Dashboard header for the [Admin Bar Removal](//wordpress.org/plugins/wp-admin-bar-removal/) plugin.
* Adds a single-click logout to Dashboard
* Works with multisite installations.

`sLa NGjI's Team do not provide support on wordpress.org forum!`

Dear user of plugins or themes:

`sLa NGjIâ€™s Team has started adventure on
wordpress.org forum since 2007: 7 years ago!`

Everything was very different from today: the plugins and themes developed by us were much less, and also the users who used it.

The traffic generated by users of the wordpress.org forum has increased exponentially, and in the same way also the requests for assistance have increased exponentially.

In the near future this increase will be even more pronounced, as a result of the great success of WordPress.

By contrast, both the posts and threads definable "requests" and those definable "trash" are very difficult to finding and follow: the time necessary for this purpose, now, longer a nightmare that one added value service, real.

With the passage of time, the problems of this type of assistance have been deemed ineffective by more and more developers excellent, while the tools available for this workload considered insufficient or inadequate to many of them.

Many of these developers have already abandoned this platform of assistance by providing other methods of customer care.

Our team has tried to respond to all for seven long years, and maintained the support forums for plugins and themes developed always clean, neat, and clear.

Failing to provide a service that gives us satisfaction, through the instruments of wordpress.org forum, as of today August 15, 2014 we abandon the active support with this type of structure, started since August 7, 2007 to try to give one type of service more personalized, and targeted, to requests of users.

1. For bug's please refer to [sLa NGjI's GitHub ](//github.com/slangji/) bug's report support
1. For tickets please refer to [sLa NGjI's Contact](//slangji.wordpress.com/contact/) tickets form support

* Please note that:
 * We are not interested in reviews on our plugins and themes.
 * Do not write anything like that!
 * We are not interested in stars on our plugins and themes.
 * Do not make any in that sections!

Generally we're not interested to be informed if you like our plugins and themes, or if you use them successfully through the instruments of the wordpress.org forums!

Remember to keep proper behavior on the wordpress.org forum, under the rules, respect all their moderators, and its users: this team do not supporting anymore wordpress.org forum, and the possibility that some of us then reply or write on wordpress.org forum, will be very low!
